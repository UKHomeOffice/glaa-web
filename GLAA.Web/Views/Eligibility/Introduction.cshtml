                The Principal Authority of the licence being issued should create the account. If this is incorrect it could delay the process or even void the application form.

            <p>
                Principal Authority (PA) is a term that we use to describe the person responsible for the day to day management of the business.  In the case of a company the PA will normally be the managing director.  If there is a person in your company that meets this definition, that person should be named as the PA on the application rather than yourself.  If you are responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, then we will require written confirmation by letter or email from a director of your company providing confirmation that you meet the definition of a PA.
